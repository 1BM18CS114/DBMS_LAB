--i. Find the names of all Juniors (level = JR) who are enrolled in a class taught by
select * from Student, Faculty, Enrolled where lvl = 'SR' and fname = 'Namratha';

ii. Find the names of all classes that either meet in room R128 or have five or more Students enrolled.
iii. Find the names of all students who are enrolled in two classes that meet at the same time.
iv. Find the names of faculty members who teach in every room in which some class is taught.
v. Find the names of faculty members for whom the combined enrollment of the courses that they teach is less than five.
vi. Find the names of students who are not enrolled in any class.
vii. For each age value that appears in Students, find the level value that appears most often.
For example, if there are more FR level students aged 18 than SR, JR, or SO students aged 18, you should print the pair (18, FR).
